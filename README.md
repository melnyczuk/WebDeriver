# Google Street Derive

An artwork by How Melnyczuk.

Google Street Derive uses Selenium Webdriver to automatically drift around Google Street view.

It is a technological exploration of Situationist philosophy and practice, that also explores the socio-corporate layers of psudeoreality that overlap the physical world.
