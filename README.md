# Google Street Derive

An artwork by How Melnyczuk.

Google Street Derive uses Selenium Webdriver to automatically drift around Google Street view.

It is a technological exploration of Situationist philosophy and practice, that also explores the socio-corporate layers of psudeoreality that overlap the physical world.

## Todo:
- [ ] Fix 'big turn' logic for when the agent is stuck
- [ ] Make PsychoGeographer class interface with [dowsing rod](https://github.com/melnyczuk/dowsing_rod) to make decisions about where to go
- [ ] Make PsychoGeographer into ML python app
- [ ] Add screen readout to display the agent's inner monologue
